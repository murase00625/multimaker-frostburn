/**
 * @author Morio Murase
 * 
 * Here's a simple example of a subscribed event, or a method that can be attached
 * to an existing event in Minecraft.
 * 
 * With this code, Minecraft will randomly drop 0, 1, or 2 Bones when a Cow or Sheep
 * are killed. Now you can have Bones and Bonemeal in Peaceful difficulty.
 * 
 * Although there's a SubscribeEvent annotation, that doesn't mean the method will
 * be activated-- at some point in the initialization process, this code has to be
 * injected into Minecraft. That code is in the main class.
